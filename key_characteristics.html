<h2 id="scalability">Scalability</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The capability of a system to grow and manage increased demand.</li>
  <li>A system that can continuously evolve to support growing amount of work is scalable.</li>
  <li>Horizontal scaling: by adding more servers into the pool of resources.</li>
  <li>Vertical scaling: by adding more resource (CPU, RAM, storage, etc) to an existing server. This approach comes with downtime and an upper limit.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reliability">Reliability</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Reliability is the probability that a system will fail in a given period.</li>
  <li>A distributed system is reliable if it keeps delivering its service even when one or multiple components fail.</li>
  <li>Reliability is achieved through redundancy of components and data (remove every single point of failure).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Availability is the time a system remains operational to perform its required function in a specific period.</li>
  <li>Measured by the percentage of time that a system remains operational under normal conditions.</li>
  <li>A reliable system is available.</li>
  <li>An available system is not necessarily reliable.
    <ul>
      <li>A system with a security hole is available when there is no security attack.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Latency: response time, the delay to obtain the first piece of data.</li>
  <li>Bandwidth: throughput, amount of data delivered in a given time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="serviceability--manageability">Serviceability / Manageability</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Easiness to operate and maintain the system.</li>
  <li>Simplicity and spend with which a system can be repaired or maintained.</li>
</ul>
